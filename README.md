This is a client library for the
[Heroku Platform API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference)
that can be used by Web applications.

The library relies on the
[fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), which
can be used natively in [most modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/fetch), and on
the
[WebCrypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API),
which is also [quite well supported](http://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography).
A [fetch polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) and a
[WebCrypto polyfill](https://github.com/polycrypt/polycrypt) can be used to
extend this library's compatibility all the way down to Internet Explorer 10.


## Development Setup

Install the project's dependencies and run a one-time setup script.

```bash
npm install
HEROKU_ACCOUNT=email:password node test/setup.js
```

Create a testing Heroku account and plug in the email and password into
`testdata/heroku_account.json`. Using a real Heroku account is not recommended,
as bugs in the library could result in your applications getting deleted.

```json
{
  "email": "your@test.account",
  "password": "your-secret"
}
```
